# ptravels
An interactive geocoding app to map your shows using the Phish.net API and Google geocoding API
## Usage
Type a phish.net username into the top-right search box and hit enter. The app queries the phish.net API for your shows attended, and passes the 
venue, city, state information to the Google geocoding API. Using the leaflet.js library, markers are added to the map at the location of the show.
